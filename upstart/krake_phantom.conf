# Reference: https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/examples/upstart/sidekiq.conf
# /etc/init/krake_phantom.conf - Sidekiq config

# This example config should work with Ubuntu 12.04+.  It
# allows you to manage multiple Sidekiq instances with
# Upstart, Ubuntu's native service management tool.
#
# See workers.conf for how to manage all Sidekiq instances at once.
#
# Save this config as /etc/init/krake_phantom.conf then manage krake_phantom with:
#   sudo start krake_phantom
#   sudo stop krake_phantom
#   sudo status krake_phantom
#
# Hack Upstart's reload command to 'quiet' Sidekiq:
#
#   sudo reload krake_phantom
#
# or use the service command:
#   sudo service krake_phantom {start,stop,restart,status}
#

description "PhantomJs Server"

# This script is not meant to start on bootup, workers.conf
# will start all sidekiq instances explicitly when it starts.
#start on runlevel [2345]
#stop on runlevel [06]
